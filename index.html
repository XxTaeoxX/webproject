  <h1>My Top 3 Favorite boxers</h1>
  <section>

        <div>
            <h2>Canelo Alverez</h2>
            <P>I put Canelo at #1 cause he has won many fights and lost but I say he is a good fighter. Canelo i say has the ability to become one of the best fighters. He has won many world titles.</P>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Miguel cotto</h2>
            <p>I Put Miguel Cotto at #2 because even he is a good fighter. Miguel Cotto has good style in this sport. He is the first Puerto Rican to win world titles in 4 weight classes.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Manny Pacquiao</h2>
            <p>I put Manny Pacquiao at #3 because even though he has many fights he is still not my favorite. Manny Pacquiao has won many fight but also has lost but he still makes the top 3 for my list.</p>
